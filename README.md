Brent Browney Homework week 3

The Password generator allows the user to click generate password which will then allow them to generate a password at random. 

They are then prompted to detail how many characters they desire in their password to include between 8-128 characters. Through the next prompts, they are asked if they would like their password to include character symbols, numbers, lower case and/or upper case lettering.

Once all prompts have been selected whether with a value or neither by hitting cancel, the password is generated from their selection to include or exclude the prompts in the password box they have input.
